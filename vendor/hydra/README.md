Hydra coordinates three AI coding agents — [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), and [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — through a shared HTTP daemon with a task queue, intelligent routing, and structured multi-round deliberation.

## Why Hydra?

Each AI coding agent has strengths: Claude is a strong architect, Gemini excels at analysis and critique, Codex is a fast implementer. Running them individually means choosing one perspective per task.

Hydra lets you use all three together:

- **Route work to the right agent** — a local heuristic classifies your prompt and picks the best agent (or pair, or all three) with zero extra API calls
- **Run agents in parallel** — headless workers claim tasks from a shared queue and execute concurrently in isolated git worktrees
- **Multi-round deliberation** — Claude proposes, Gemini critiques, Claude refines, Codex implements
- **Self-improving pipelines** — nightly automation scans your codebase for TODOs, issues, and improvements, then executes them autonomously with budget tracking and self-healing on failures

## Requirements

- **Node.js 20+**
- **PowerShell 7+** (for Windows launchers; Linux/macOS can run the Node modules directly)
- **At least one AI CLI installed:** [`gemini`](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [`codex`](https://github.com/openai/codex), or [`claude`](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
- Optional: [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com) for GitHub integration (PRs, issue scanning)
- Optional: [`@opentelemetry/api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/api) for distributed tracing

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/PrimeLocus/Hydra.git
cd Hydra
npm install

# Launch the operator console
node lib/hydra-operator.mjs

# Or on Windows with PowerShell launchers:
pwsh -File .\bin\install-hydra-cli.ps1   # one-time: adds 'hydra' command
hydra                                     # operator console
hydra --full                              # daemon + agent heads + operator
```

Once in the operator console, type a prompt and Hydra routes it automatically. Use `:help` to see all commands.

## CLI Integration

After installing Hydra, register its MCP server with your AI CLIs:

```bash
hydra setup
```

This detects installed CLIs (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI) and registers the Hydra MCP server globally. New CLI sessions will have access to Hydra coordination tools (`hydra_ask`, `hydra_tasks_claim`, `hydra_status`, etc.).

To make a project Hydra-aware (generates per-agent coordination instructions):

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
hydra init
```

To remove the MCP registration:

```bash
hydra setup --uninstall
```

## Features

### Orchestration & Routing

- **Five orchestration modes**: Auto (3-way routing), Council (multi-round deliberation with structured synthesis), Dispatch (headless pipeline), Smart (auto-tier per complexity), Chat (concierge conversation)
- **Intelligent route classification**: Local heuristic classifies prompts into single/tandem/council routes — zero agent CLI calls for routing
- **Tandem dispatch**: 2-agent lead-follow pairs (e.g., Claude analyzes, Codex implements)
- **Affinity-based task routing**: 10 task types across 3 agents with adaptive learning from outcomes
- **Virtual sub-agents**: Role-specialized agents (security-reviewer, test-writer, doc-generator, researcher) that resolve to physical agents

### Concierge Chat

- **Multi-provider front-end**: Conversational AI (OpenAI → Anthropic → Google fallback) — answers questions directly, escalates to agents when real work is needed
- **Situational awareness**: "What's going on?" fetches real-time activity from daemon and agents
- **Codebase knowledge**: "How does dispatch work?" injects architecture context from docs and knowledge base
- **Command-aware**: Fuzzy matching catches typos before falling back to AI suggestions

### Agent & Model Management

- **Per-agent model switching**: Trade quality for speed/cost at runtime
- **Interactive model picker**: Type-to-filter browser with reasoning effort configuration
- **Headless workers**: Background agent execution with claim-execute-report loop
- **Agent Forge**: Multi-model agent creation pipeline — Gemini analyzes, Claude designs, Gemini critiques, Claude refines, optional live test

### Monitoring & Safety

- **Token usage monitoring**: Three-tier budget tracking (weekly, daily, sliding window) with auto model-switching at critical levels
- **Model recovery**: Automatic fallback when a model is unavailable or rate-limited
- **Rate limit resilience**: Exponential backoff with jitter across all providers
- **Failure doctor**: Diagnoses pipeline failures, detects recurring patterns, auto-creates follow-up tasks
- **Circuit breaker**: Per-model failure tracking with automatic recovery after cool-down
- **5-line status bar**: Persistent terminal footer with agent activity, token gauge, and event ticker

### Automation Pipelines

- **Nightly runner**: Scans TODO comments, `docs/TODO.md`, and GitHub issues → prioritizes → executes autonomously with budget tracking
- **Evolve**: 7-phase autonomous self-improvement with investigator self-healing and knowledge accumulation
- **Tasks runner**: Per-task branch isolation, council-lite review for complex tasks, JSON + Markdown reports
- **AI discovery**: Agent analyzes codebase and suggests improvement tasks
- **Commit attribution**: Automated commits include `Originated-By:` and `Executed-By:` git trailers

### Platform & Infrastructure

- **Event-sourced daemon**: HTTP state management with replay, snapshots, and dead-letter queue
- **Git worktree isolation**: Per-task isolated filesystems for parallel agent work
- **MCP server**: 11 tools, 5 resources, 3 prompts via official SDK (protocol 2025-03-26)
- **Streaming middleware**: Composable pipeline — rate limiting, circuit breaking, retry, telemetry
- **OTel tracing**: Optional distributed tracing with GenAI semantic conventions
- **Heartbeat crash recovery**: Daemon detects stale workers and requeues or dead-letters tasks
